# UD Editor — Graphical Universal Dependencies Editing & Visualization

**UD Editor** is an interactive, web-based tool for **editing and visualizing Universal Dependencies (UD) structures**. It provides a dynamic graphical interface that allows linguists, corpus developers, and NLP engineers to create, modify, and explore dependency trees in an intuitive, visual way — without manually editing raw CoNLL-U text files.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Graphical tree visualization**  
  Render UD dependency trees visually, highlighting tokens and syntactic relations in an interactive graph — making complex sentence structures easier to comprehend at a glance.

- **Dynamic dependency editing**  
  Add, remove, or reconnect dependency arcs by interacting directly with the visualization, allowing for rapid corrections and adjustments to syntax trees.

- **CoNLL-U integration**  
  Load and save data in the standard CoNLL-U format used by UD corpora, facilitating compatibility with existing UD resources and toolchains.

- **Interactive user interface**  
  User-friendly controls with real-time updates while editing, reducing the cognitive load compared to editing plain-text representations.

- **Visualization customization**  
  Adjust layout, expand or collapse subtrees, and adapt the visual representation to different annotation or analysis workflows.

## 🎯 Purpose

UD Editor is designed to support both **expert linguists and newcomers** working with Universal Dependencies. It enables users to:

- Quickly **annotate and correct dependency trees**
- **Visualize syntactic structures** in natural language data
- Inspect and refine **parser outputs**
- Support **linguistic annotation projects** and teaching activities

The editor integrates naturally with projects developed within the **Tycho Brahe Platform**, supporting a complete workflow for corpus creation, revision, and syntactic analysis.

## 📦 Use Cases

- Building and maintaining UD treebanks
- Manual revision of automatically parsed sentences
- Linguistic research and corpus linguistics
- Teaching syntax and dependency grammar
